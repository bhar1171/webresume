        I got an opportunity to complete International Baccalaureate Diploma (IB) at the United World College (UWC) Red cross Nordic in Norway.
        At UWC, I had an opportunity to study with students from 95 countries, whose culture, religion, and background was different from me, but still we managed to live with peace.
        We lived with the goal to promote peace, fairness and sustainable future.
