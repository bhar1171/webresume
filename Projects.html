        1) <b>Database Project:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        This was a two moths long project in which four of us were asked to develop a database system for conceptual company called Sooner Tire.
        To do so, we were given a data in excel sheet which we had to manipulate and turn it into usable format. Then develop ERD model,
        Logical model, dictionary, then upload the data on SQL seriver and then run SQL queries. At first, we did not know how to develop that peoject,
        however, as time passed and some advanced things we leanred from database class such as ERD modeling, business cycles, and advanced SQL, we developed the databse system.
        In fact, we ran a SQL queries and produced results from it.

        2) <b>R Project:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        In R project, we were asked to analyze and estimate whether plane industory is safer compared to the car industory.
        To do so, data was provided and we had to plot graphs using R platform and write executive summary. I found out that the
        traveling by plane is safer than the car. There were many factors that were taken into account to make final conclusion.

        3) <b>Data Science and Analytics: </b>
        <br />
        <br />
        In this project, we were asked to analyze the data using regression analysis, decision tree, clustor analysis and associton rule
        to predit the possibility of outcome. To do so, we had to fist validate the dataset, test it and then use the confision matrix
        in come cases to find the accuracy of the model. We developed mathematical models as well.
